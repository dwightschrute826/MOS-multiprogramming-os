# MOS-multiprogramming-os
A two-phase Multiprogramming Operating System (MOS) with interrupt handling, paging, and process management.

✅ Phase 1:

. Single-program execution model
. Job loading, execution, and I/O handling
. Basic instruction execution using registers


✅ Phase 2:

. Multiprogramming with paging-based memory management
. Interrupt handling (SI, TI, PI) for I/O, timeouts, and program errors
. Process Control Block (PCB) & Page Tables (PT) for efficient memory management
